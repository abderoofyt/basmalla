             <p>The <acronym title="bi-smi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīmi ">Basmala</acronym> (Arabic: بَسْمَلَة, basmalah; also known by its incipit Bi-smi llāh; بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ, "In the name of Allah"),[1] 
              or Tasmiyyah (Arabic: تَسْمِيَّة), is the titular name of the Islamic phrase "In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"
               (Arabic: بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ, bi-smi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīmi). It is one of the most important phrases in Islam and 
               is used by Muslims mostly before starting "good deeds" for <span class="titleTip" title="The Islamic word for Heaven.">Jannah</span> 
               (for instance, during daily prayer) as well as beginning of most daily actions.</p>

              <p>It is used in over half of the constitutions of countries where Islam is the official religion or more than half of the population follows Islam, 
              usually the first phrase in the preamble, including those of Afghanistan,[2] Bahrain,[3] Bangladesh,[4] Brunei,[5] Egypt,[6] Iran,[7] Iraq,[8] Kuwait,[9]
               Libya,[10] Maldives,[11] Pakistan,[12] Saudi Arabia,[13] Tunisia[14] and the United Arab Emirates.[15]</p>
    
              
              <p>It is the phrase recited before each chapter (surah) of the <span lang="la">Quran</span>except for the ninth.[Notes 2][16] Muslim disagreement over whether to
               include the Basmala within the Quranic text, reached consensus following the 1924 Cairo Edition, which included it as the first verse (āyah)
                of <span lang="la">Quran</span> chapter 1 but otherwise included it as an unnumbered line of text preceding the other relevant 112 chapters.[17]</p>
              
              <p>The Islamic Basmala appears to be related to earlier variants of the phrase appearing in Arabian inscriptions from the 5th and 6th centuries.
              In Arabic calligraphy, the Basmala is the most prevalent motif, even more so than the Shahadah.</p>

          <p><acronym title="(Arabic: تفسير, romanized: tafsīr [tafˈsiːr])">Tafsir</acronym> refers to exegesis, usually of the Quran. An author of a 
            tafsir is a mufassir (Arabic: مُفسّر; plural: Arabic: مفسّرون, romanized: mufassirūn). A Quranic tafsir attempts 
            to provide elucidation, explanation, interpretation, context or commentary for clear understanding and conviction of God's will.

            Principally, a tafsir deals with the issues of linguistics, jurisprudence, and theology. In terms of perspective and approach, 
            tafsir can be broadly divided into two main categories, namely tafsir bi-al-ma'thur (lit. received tafsir), which is transmitted 
            from the early days of Islam through the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions, and tafsir bi-al-ra'y (lit. tafsir by opinion),
             which is arrived through personal reflection or independent rational thinking.</p>

            see Allahu Akbar (disambiguation).
            The <acronym title="(Arabic: تَكْبِير, pronounced [tak.biːr])">Takbir</acronym>, "magnification [of God]" is the name for the 
            Arabic phrase ʾAllāhu ʾakbaru (ٱللَّٰهُ أَكْبَرُ, pronounced [ʔaɫ.ɫaː.hu ʔak.baru] (listen)), meaning "God is the greatest".
            
            It is a common Arabic expression, used in various contexts by Muslims and Arabs around the world: in formal Salah (prayer),
            in the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer), in Hajj, as an informal expression of faith, in times of distress or joy, or to express 
            resolute determination or defiance. The phrase is also used by Arab Christians..</p>

          <p>The <acronym title="(Arabic: تَهْلِيل, , Arabic pronunciation: [tah.liːl])">tahlīl</acronym> , also spelled Tahleel, is a form of dhikr that 
            involves the praising of God in Islam by saying lā ʾilāha ʾillā -llāhu (لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ), meaning "There is none worthy
             of worship except Allah".</p>

             content accessibility.</p>

          <p><acronym title="(Arabic: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ, al-Ḥamdu lillāh)">Tahmeed</acronym> Alhamdulillah  is an Arabic phrase meaning "praise be to God",
            sometimes translated as "thank God". This phrase is called Tahmid (Arabic: تَحْمِيد, lit. 'Praising').
           A longer variant of the phrase is al-ḥamdu l-illāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīn (ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّٰهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ), meaning 
            "all praise is due to God, Lord of all the worlds", first verse of Surah Al-Fatiha.

            The phrase is frequently used by Muslims of every background due to its centrality in the texts of the Quran 
            and Hadith, the words of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Its meaning and in-depth explanation have been the subject
             of much exegesis. It is also commonly used by non-Muslim speakers of the Arabic language.</p>
